## VB Metronome


</div>

### Description

A metronome (used in music for keeping time) written in Visual Basic, using one API call. Assumes that you have a working sound card, or other method for playing a sound. Theoretically, it can support any BPM setting, but realistically, I set the limits to 31-500 BPM. Also includes Cut Time, allowing for the beat to be twice as fast. WARNING : DO NOT DELETE THE INCLUDED WAV FILES. THE PROGRAM NEEDS THEM!
